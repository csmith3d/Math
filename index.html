      <h1>Math</h1>
      <p>Math is a simple web application for studying math lists.</p>
      <a href="Math"><p><img src="Math/MathIcon256.png" alt="Math" id="MathIcon" /><span style="font-size: 150%; padding-left: 0.25em;">Open Now</span></p></a>
      <p>Instructions (including phone and tablet installation):
	<ul>
	  <li>Note: this has been tested on iOS, but not Android.  It probably works on Android, but maybe not.  It should work on a computer.</li>
	  <li>If you can't figure an answer out, click/tap the "Show Me" button.  This will place the correct answer in the text entry field.  Clicking/tapping "Check Answer" will then move you to the next question.
	  <li>Your progress is charted on the right with a number representing each problem.  If you get an answer right on the first try, it turns green, and you won't see it again this session.  If it takes two or more tries, then the number stays black, and you'll review it again the next time through.</li>
	  <li>Once you've correctly answered each question without a mistake, you'll get an alert that you're done, and the app will reset to the first question.</li>
	  <li> There are settings options in the upper left (the button with three horizontal lines). </li>
	  <li> Installation instructions:
	    <ul>
	      <li>This web app can be installed as an icon on the home screen of a phone or tablet.</li>
	      <li>Android: Open in Chrome. Tap the three dots in the upper right of the browser and select "Add to Home screen."</li>
	      <li>iOS: Open in Safari.  In the browser controls, tap the icon that's a square with an arrow coming up out of it.  Scroll over and select "Add to Home Screen."</li>
	      <li>Note: Web apps are finicky about updates.  In theory, if you have an active internet connection and open the app and there's a new version available, then the next time you launch the app, the new version will be up . . . but not always.  You may need to uninstall the app from your home screen, visit the app URL again in your browser, hit refresh a couple times, and re-install the icon on your home screen.  Then, launch it from your home screen, quit it, and launch it again.  That usually gets it to update for me.</li>
